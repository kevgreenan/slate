# Slate
A project environment initializer

## How do I use it?
Easy!  Just download all of the files to your home directory, then open a terminal and run `slate.py`.  For now, it will clone all of MY GitHub repos, should you choose to do so.  GitHub functionality is a work in progress, and coming soon.  To fix this for now, just replace my urls in the `gitURLS` list with your own.
